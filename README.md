___

Parley is a platform where students can share their experiences at their schools and universities and form a more close and connected community. Students can share their day to day stories and ask for academic questions as well as advices related to personal lives. We have seen sites like stackoverflow but thats not what we are trying to replicate. Our focus is more on the broader experience of teenagers as students.
